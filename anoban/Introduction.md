# ___What is machine learning?___
-------------------

- ML is the study of computer programes that can learn from examples.

- Common tasks like natural language processing (text processing, speech recognition), classification problems will need humongous amounts of time and effort, if we are to write programmes by hand. Even then, our programmes will be less flexible and may produce erroneous results on inputs that are different than the inputs they are specifically tailored for.

- ML models can learn from examples (training data). This makes the above tasks much more easier than hand coded examples.

- ML algorithms learn rules from labelled examples.

- The set of labelled examples used for learning is called the training data.

- Learned rules must be generic and flexible with a satisfactory accuracy that they can correctly recognize or make predictions for new inputs that were not present in the training datasets.

- Machine learning has strong foundations in statistics and computer science. Statistics lays the groundwork to study, define, analyze and improve algorithms and computer science gives the computing power to materialize these statistical concepts.

- ML has expanded its applications into other domains like economics, biology and psychology.
